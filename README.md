In this repository, we follow the "[COVID Detection Using Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/OFF2iW73wZg)" video by [Edureka](https://www.edureka.co/ai-deep-learning-with-tensorflow). This repository is providing a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of image classification and how it can be implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Moreover, the source is working on image processing with Python and also will learn about the CNN. Finally, the code provides an end-to-end model to process and identify the Covid X-Ray images with CNN. For the purpose, we used both "[COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)" and "[Actualmed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative](https://github.com/agchung/Actualmed-COVID-chestxray-dataset)" for training our model. This source code is based on the [`Covid_detection_CNN
`](https://github.com/junaidiqbalsyed/Covid_detection_CNN) repository.
